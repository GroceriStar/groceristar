GL
* add
* created from Main Menu(nothing was changed)
* created from User Menu (GL not saved to db in this case)
* if user want to add some products to GL - we create GL related to User Menu for this week
* when user check ingredient(we assume he buy it) - this ingredient moved to Purchased. Purchased must have this information: qty / Date / notes/ place where it was buyed.


create functionality when user uncheck ingredient from GL - so we need to remove it from Purchased list too.
