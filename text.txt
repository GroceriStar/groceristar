PREP DAY

From week to week, you’ll
have leftovers from your Prep
Day: The salmon and chicken
recipes, for example, yield

an extra piece to stash in the
freezer, and the pots of oat-
meal and quinoa make double
batches (also freezable).
Before you shop for weeks two
and three, do a quick scan to
see what’s already good to go!
